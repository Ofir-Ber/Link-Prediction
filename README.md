# Link-Prediction

# Predicting missing links in a citation network
Edges have been deleted at random from a citation network. Your mission is to accurately reconstruct the initial network using graph-theoretical, textual, and other information.

In this competition, we define a citation network as a graph where nodes are research papers and there is an edge between two nodes if one of the two papers cite the other.

In addition to the graph structure, each node (i.e., article) is also associated with information such as the title of the paper, publication year, author names and a short abstract.

Your goal is to utilize information from both the underlying citation network and the textual information in order to accurately predict missing edges.
